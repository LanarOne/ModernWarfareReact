                <h3>The first submarine station</h3>
                <p>
                  The Future Warfare Corporation started as a business
                  specialized in submarines armored vehicles. From excellents
                  alloys and technologies our beloved founder draw the first
                  design of a submarine station capable of harboring 500 men,
                  two kilometers down sea level.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Used in the first international Water War, it was one of many
                  assets that allowed the Nation to overcome its ennemies.
                  Capable of launching numerous nuclear heads from deep below
                  without getting spotted, it was also able to defend itself
                  from submarines and was too deep in the water for any other
                  form of weaponry to get at it. Hell! Some of them were not
                  even found after the wars!

                <h3>The war mecas</h3>
                <p>
                  After dominating the seas, FWC started to manufacture war
                  mecas. These machines only existed in science fiction but we
                  made it a reality! It is said that the CEO himself draw the
                  first blueprints of this first war meca.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The WM#2.6, the first prototype that was ever able to be
                  deployed on a battlefield. While AI could have drove this
                  technological beauty, two men inside the bot would operate it
                  for strategic purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since then, most of the ancient war mecas have been bought by
                  the construction business, inventing new uses that were later
                  inplemented in the new versions.

                <p>
                  Space vehicles were the logic choice after our terrestrial
                  venture. Warfare is everywhere and at the time of the first
                  encounters with non-human species, it was needed for the
                  Nation to defend itself. That is what FWC provided.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This space shuttle was our first to fly to Mars, land there
                  and came back on earth. It was used to establish the first
                  Martian base and was the ultimate experience to upgrade our
                  technologies to the next level.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The SS#3.4 is fully armored and equipped with a range of
                  weapons that can shoot in open space. With its closed water
                  loop and growing space, Humans could survive almost for ever
                  in outterspace.

                <p>
                  The journey of armored technologies brought us up into space,
                  it was only logical that we would engineer the first floating
                  station ever inhabited. It was for a long time the legal and
                  official base for our corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This precise unit is still in Terra's orbit, although
                  originally built for ten thousand people to live in, it has
                  been upgraded since and can now shelter almost half a million
                  souls.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is true that the condition on most of our planet makes it
                  impossible for us to survive down there, but with the
                  intelligence and resilience of humanity, we now offer
                  prosperous way of living in outter space!
